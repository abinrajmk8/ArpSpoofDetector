# ARP Spoofing Detection and Attack Simulation Toolkit

This project provides a set of Python tools for simulating and detecting ARP spoofing attacks. It includes a packet sniffer, an ARP spoofing detector, an ARP spoof attack simulator, and a utility to dynamically detect the active network interface. This project is intended for educational purposes and should be used in controlled environments only.

1. Overview of Each Script

- arp_spoofing_detector.py  
  Detects ARP spoofing attacks in real-time. It uses packet sniffing and MAC address validation to alert if a spoofed ARP packet is detected. This is the main detection script.

- attack_simulator.py  
  Simulates an ARP spoofing attack by sending forged ARP replies to a victim and the gateway. Can be used to test the detector in a local environment. Must be stopped with CTRL + C, which will restore the ARP tables to prevent disruption.

- packet_sniffer.py  
  Sniffs HTTP traffic and attempts to detect potential login information like usernames and passwords in plaintext HTTP requests. Useful for understanding how sensitive information can be captured over insecure protocols.

- interface_fetcher.py  
  Fetches the active network interface used by your system. This is used by the other scripts to determine which interface to sniff traffic on, so you donâ€™t have to specify it manually. This is especially used by the ARP spoofing detector.

2. Python Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.8 or later installed.

For Windows:

1. Download Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Run the installer.
3. During installation, check the box that says "Add Python to PATH".
4. After installation, confirm with:

   python --version

For Linux/macOS:

Most systems come with Python pre-installed. To verify:

   python3 --version

If not installed:

Ubuntu/Debian:

   sudo apt update  
   sudo apt install python3 python3-pip

Fedora:

   sudo dnf install python3

macOS (Homebrew):

   brew install python

3. Setting Up the Virtual Environment

Creating a virtual environment keeps your dependencies isolated.

For Windows:

   python -m venv venv  
   venv\Scripts\activate

For Linux/macOS:

   python3 -m venv venv  
   source venv/bin/activate

4. Installing Required Modules

This project depends on the Scapy library.

To install it:

   pip install scapy

Or using a requirements.txt file:

   echo scapy > requirements.txt  
   pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Running the Project (Step-by-Step)

Step 1: Start ARP Spoofing Detection

This is the main script. Run this first.

   python arp_spoofing_detector.py

- Automatically detects your active network interface  
- Monitors ARP traffic  
- Detects and warns about spoofing attempts

Step 2: Simulate ARP Spoofing Attack (Optional)

Use this to test the detector.

1. Edit target and gateway IPs inside attack_simulator.py  
2. Run:

   python attack_simulator.py

3. Stop with CTRL + C. The script will restore the original ARP tables.

Warning: Only run in isolated lab environments.

Step 3: Run Packet Sniffer (Optional)

   python packet_sniffer.py

- Sniffs HTTP requests  
- Shows visited URLs and possible login info  
- Note: Works only for HTTP (not HTTPS)
